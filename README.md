# Enter the Pixel Playground of Basith Ahmed üáÆüá≥

**Level 18 Computer Science Student, hailing from the land of chai and spicy delights, reporting for duty!**

**My arsenal:**

* **Languages:** HTML , CSS , JavaScript ‚ú® (and its fancy friend TypeScript ), C  (the OG warrior), Python  (for data-wrangling adventures), and Jupyter Notebooks  (my secret weapon for data exploration)
* **Technologies:** Node.js  (building lightning-fast servers), React.js‚öõÔ∏è (crafting stunning interfaces), Express.js  (the API architect), Next.js ‚ö°Ô∏è (for blazing-fast web apps), Git  (my version control companion), and GitHub  (showcasing my conquests to the world)

**I've conquered several full-stack quests, from pixel-perfect websites to data-driven fortresses.** Explore them here: [Portfolio](https://github.com/Basith-Ahmed)

**But my journey doesn't stop at code.** I'm also a UI/UX design enthusiast, on a mission to create interfaces that are both user-friendly and visually stunning. ‚ú®

**When I'm not battling bugs, you can find me freelancing, using my skills to build real-world wonders.**
