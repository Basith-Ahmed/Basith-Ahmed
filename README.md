# Hi there! 

I'm an 18-year-old computer science student from India, with a thirst for chai and a passion for building full-stack wonders! 

**My digital toolbox:**

* **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, Python (and Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration!)
* **Technologies:** Node.js, React.js, Express.js, Next.js, Git (branch master extraordinaire!), and GitHub (showcasing my projects with pride!)

**I've crafted several full-stack projects, from eye-catching websites to data-driven apps.** Dive into them here: [Profile](https://github.com/Basith-Ahmed)

**But code isn't my only love.** I'm also drawn to the world of UI/UX design, aiming to create interfaces that are both functional and delightful. âœ¨

**When I'm not hacking away, you can find me freelancing, applying my skills to real-world projects.** 

**Up for a tech adventure? Let's connect!**

* **LinkedIn:** [Basith Ahmed](www.linkedin.com/in/basith-ahmed)
* **Let's chat:** Feel free to reach out and discuss code, design, or anything tech-related!

**This is just the beginning of my coding journey, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.** Stay tuned for more codetastic adventures!
